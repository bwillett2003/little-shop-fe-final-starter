### Abstract:
The Starter repo already had the ability to view items for a specific merchant, edit a merchant's name, add or delete a merchant.
My addition to the project shows the merchant's coupons and their information.

### Installation Instructions:
- Fork repo
- Clone forked repo and rename it `git clone <repo> <new name>`
- `cd` into cloned repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to start developing.
- You'll see in the terminal that the project has opened at "http://localhost:5173/"

### Preview of App:
(Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
Approx 1 week to work on this project. When viewing the coupons for a merchant, you can see the coupons formatted the same at merchant view. 
There is a back to merchants button. Shows the merchant id as well as the merchant name. Slight button hover color change.

### Learning Goals:
Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
Implement CRUD functionality for a resource
Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in serializers and controllers
Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
Write request tests that fully cover the functionality of the application
Display data for users in a frontend application by targeting DOM elements

### Wins + Challenges:
Having the BE and FE function together.
Adding additional features to the FE.
Creating a Postman collection.
The challenges were trying to remember exactly what I needed to do step by step to prevent breaking things along the way.
